/** integrate equations of motion
    \param n_steps number of steps to integrate.
    \param reuse_forces if nonzero, blindly trust
    the forces still stored with the particles for the first time step.

    @details This function calls two hooks for propagation kernels such as
    velocity verlet, velocity verlet + npt box changes, and steepest_descent.
    One hook is called before and one after the force calculation.
    It is up to the propagation kernels to increment the simulation time.

    This function propagates the system according to the choice of integrator
    stored in @ref integ_switch. The general structure is:
    - if reuse_forces is zero, recalculate the forces based on the current
      state of the system
    - Loop over the number of simulation steps:
      -# initialization (e.g., RATTLE)
      -# First hook for propagation kernels
      -# Update dependent particles and properties (RATTLE, virtual sites)
      -# Calculate forces for the current state of the system. This includes
   forces added by the Langevin thermostat and the Lattice-Boltzmann-particle
   coupling
      -# Second hook for propagation kernels
      -# Update dependent properties (Virtual sites, RATTLE)
      -# Run single step algorithms (Lattice-Boltzmann propagation, collision
   detection, NPT update)
    - Final update of dependent properties and statistics/counters

    High-level documentation of the integration and thermostatting schemes
    can be found in doc/sphinx/system_setup.rst and /doc/sphinx/running.rst
